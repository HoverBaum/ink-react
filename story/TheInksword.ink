#CHAPTER: At the bonfire

It was one of those evenings around the bonfire where stories gush out like water from a spring and grow into cascading streams of adventure like rivers before they reach the sea.

And now, it was Bens turn to stand up...

* [listen] -> BensStory

#SCENE: beginning/sword

"Once there was a sword signifying the rule over this land" he began.

"But soon after the king died it vanished into the realms of myth... Until one day, a mighty wizard appeared who struck it into a stone! So that it may rest there until the next true king of our great country come and find it."

    // Should make character adventurous and experience bolder story telling.
    * [I listened intrigued]
    ~ mood = adventurous
    I continued to listen intrigued by this story of long forgotten kings and magic.

    // Character is more of a realist and will see things for what they are.
    * "What nonsense" I thought to myself.
    ~ mood = distrusting
    But I never listened to Bens stories for the news they contained. It was the entertainment that bound all of us to his lips.
  
- Ben continued "rumor has it, the stone was found over in Budshire not long ago."

Little did I know at this point what change Bens story would bring to my life.

Setting out...

[Forrest] -> ForrestRoute

=== ForrestRoute ===

Meeting Bandids...

You wishfully look at the mountain. View is probably amazing and you can't picture bandits being there.

[] -> ArrivingAtTheSword

=== MountainRoute ===

Enjoy the view....

You see the forrest from above. Looks like bandits, could be dreadful or an adventure.

Put a tunnel here to see some animals. Maybe both routes can go to the same tunnel? Could be little button in the image that points out a goat or something.

* Fail -> YouFailed

=== YouBecomeKing ===

You become the king. Maybe lamet how nice it would be to not shoulder all the responsibility.

-> theEnd

=== YouFailed ===

You go home as you were. Someone else becomes king. You think about how nice it would be to be that person.

-> theEnd


=== theEnd ===

Thank you for playing.
